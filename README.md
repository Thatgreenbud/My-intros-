# Who am I? 
hello I am a 22 year old native american college student at Arizona State University Tempe Campus! I am a rising animator, I work on my own project which means I barely have anytime to actually work on one of them, I am a Transmasc, I haven't got both surgeries yet but soon will (if I have time to make out appointments) I usually perfer to be called Finn since it's my name that I'm comfortable with, I don't mind if I get called Weed man (which is my oc's name).. Another thing is that I'm pansexual and bisexual. I have depression but I'm trying not to increase it by drug usage and 'self serving' myself but sadly I'm failing the second one, I try not to do unhealthy coping mechanisms.. But anyways I'm a **VERY** talkative person but I wish for people to approach me so I start convos with them! I'm also O'odham (I'm in coyote clan)
